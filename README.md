# QQC2StyleBridge

QtQuickControls 2 style that uses QWidget's QStyle for painting

## Introduction

This is a style for QtQuickControls 2 that uses QWidget's QStyle for painting, making it possible to achieve an higher degree of consistency between QWidget-based and QML-based apps.

NOTE: the application must be a QApplication rather than a QGuiApplication instance in order for this style to be used
